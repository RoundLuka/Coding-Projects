"""Problem 10: Edit Distance - 10áƒ¥

Challenge:
Given two strings word1 and word2, find the minimum number of operations required to convert word1 into word2. You have three operations allowed: insertion, deletion, or substitution.
Instructions:
Input: Two strings word1 and word2 (e.g., "horse", "ros").
Output: The minimum number of operations required to convert word1 into word2.
