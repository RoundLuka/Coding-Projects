"""Problem 8: Longest Consecutive Sequence - 8áƒ¥

Challenge:
Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
Instructions:
Input: A list of integers (e.g., [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]).
Output: The length of the longest consecutive sequence (e.g., 4).

# assert longest_consecutive([100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]) == 4  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
